// The single import site for the extracted JSON files.
//
// Why funnel them through one module: JSON requires `with { type: 'json' }` in Node 22+ ESM, but
// Vite/esbuild strip that attribute from bundle output (neither build.target nor importAttributesKey
// prevents it — measured). So if the same JSON is pointed at by both "the original with the attribute
// (engine/src/*.js)" and "the bundle without it (components/dist)", the consumer's bundler warns with
// "inconsistent import attributes". Only this file holds the JSON; everything else imports this module
// as external -> no JSON import survives in the bundle, so the mismatch cannot arise.

// The reduced pair: `type`/`default`/`enum_values`/bounds only, and the ui tree's option keys without
//  its page and group names. Everything they drop is upstream's authored text (packages/PROVENANCE.md
//  section 5) and nothing that only needs to KNOW a key reads it — 402KB -> 87KB and 34KB -> 15KB.
//  A settings form still needs the full artifacts; a consumer that just derives params does not.

// processes is the largest artifact (~800 KB) and is only needed once a printer is picked, so it stays a dynamic
// import. It is generated as a JS module rather than JSON precisely because of the attribute problem above, in its
// other direction: a dynamic JSON import needs the attribute in Node, and that same attribute makes browsers
// reject the text/javascript response a dev server gives for .json.
