// three-slicer/client — a promise wrapper over the slice worker's message protocol.
//
// Why it exists: the worker is the recommended way to slice in a browser (the kernel blocks its thread for
// seconds), but driving it meant hand-writing a `cmd` string protocol, assembling the streamed layers, knowing
// that a slice request is the one message with NO cmd and that its params must already be a JSON string, and
// reaching into a SharedArrayBuffer at an offset the worker posts once to cancel anything. All of that lived in
// the viewer and was not published.
//
// What it deliberately does NOT do: the viewer's progress weighting (its 15/5/40/40 phase budget is measured
// against ITS models) and its out-of-memory retry ladder (re-slicing simplified, then in economy mode). Those are
// UI policy — a host wanting them should own them, and lifting them here would make this a copy of the viewer.
//
// Requests are answered in order. The worker's onmessage handler processes one message at a time and each command
// replies exactly once, so a FIFO of pending requests is enough to match a reply to its caller — the protocol
// carries no request ids and does not need them.
